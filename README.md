## Developer Release Notes
###### v0.2.0
* Added mobile compatibilty. Status: Beta. May require bug fixing.
* Somewhat cleared the clutter of unwanted 'rem' and changed it to '%' and 'px', wherever found necessary. A proper drying of the code has **not** been done yet.
* Added and modified a few more classes, as required.
* Used @media for the mobile compatibility.
* A @media tag is commented. It is intended to make the website compatible with more devices. Unfortunately, it didn't bear fruits yet. It is there as a reminder to improve the compatibilty to more viewports.
* The mobiltity of 'clouds' is yet to be improved.

###### v0.1.0
* This is an absolute vanilla release.
* Most of the sizing is done in 'rem' instead of 'px' in the hope it'd ease in making the website mobile compatible. (No ease came in, as I proceeded with the next release of trying to make it mobile compatible.)
* The code here is completely different from that of actual website.
